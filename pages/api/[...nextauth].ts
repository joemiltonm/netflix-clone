/* If your [...nextauth].ts file is directly inside the 
pages/api folder without an auth folder, then the URL 
pattern would indeed be /api/*.

In this specific configuration, the [...nextauth].ts file 
would catch all API requests that match the pattern /api/* and handle 
them through NextAuth.js.*/
