/*apply is a tailwind  directive here.

h-full: This utility class sets the height of the body element to 100% of its parent container. 

overflow-x-hidden: This utility class sets the overflow-x CSS property to hidden for the body element. 
This means any child elements that would normally cause the body to overflow horizontally (left/right) will be clipped, and the overflow will be hidden.

the @apply directive is used within the body selector, not for creating a new class. It applies the styles directly to the <body> element in the HTML.

Creating a custom class using Tailwind's @apply directive is straightforward. You can define a new CSS class in your stylesheet and then use @apply to add the utility 
classes you want to incorporate into that custom class. Here's an example:

.btn-custom {
  @apply bg-blue-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 text-white;
}

used as below

<button class="btn-custom">Click Me</button>

he #__next div is created when Next.js renders your application on the client-side. It acts as a wrapper around your page content, serving as a root for your Next.js components.

If you inspect the HTML of a running Next.js application using browser development tools, you'll find a div with the ID __next, something like this:

<div id="__next"> 
  <!-- Your app content here -->
</div>


The #__next div is located within the <body> tag of the HTML document. 
It serves as the root container for your Next.js application, so all the content from your individual pages (like index.tsx, about.tsx, etc.) will be rendered inside this #__next div when the application runs.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Head content like meta tags, title, etc. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="__next">
      <!-- Content of your Next.js pages will be rendered here -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

the content from your index.tsx (or any other page component in your Next.js app) will be rendered within this #__next div, 
which itself is inside the <body> tag of the HTML document.
